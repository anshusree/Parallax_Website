                Galaxies are vast cosmic islands of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. 
                Hubble's keen eye has revealed intricate details of the shapes, structures, and histories of galaxies — 
                whether alone, as part of small groups, or within immense clusters. 
                From supermassive black holes at galactic centers to giant bursts of star formation to titanic collisions between 
                galaxies, these discoveries allow astronomers to probe the current properties of galaxies 
                as well as examine how they formed and developed over time.

            Galaxies are concentrations of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. A galaxy is held together by gravity.
            They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are fated to collide, like the Milky Way and Andromeda.

            <h2>What kinds of Galaxies are there?</h2>
                <p>
                    Astronomers classify galaxies into three major categories: elliptical, spiral and irregular. 
                    These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars 
                    to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars.<br>
                    Ellipticals, which account for about one-third of all galaxies, vary from nearly circular to very elongated.
                    They possess comparatively little gas and dust, contain older stars and are not actively forming stars anymore.
                    The largest and rarest of these, called giant ellipticals, are about 300,000 light-years across.
                    Astronomers theorize that these are formed by the mergers of smaller galaxies. 
                    Much more common are dwarf ellipticals, which are only a few thousand light-years wide.<br>
                    Spiral galaxies appear as flat, blue-white disks of stars, gas and dust with yellowish bulges in their centers. 
                    These galaxies are divided into two groups: normal spirals and barred spirals. 
                    In barred spirals, the bar of stars runs through the central bulge. 
                    The arms of barred spirals usually start at the end of the bar instead of from the bulge. 
                    Spirals are actively forming stars and comprise a large fraction of all the galaxies in the local universe.<br>
                    Irregular galaxies, which have very little dust, are neither disk-like nor elliptical. 
                    Astronomers often see iregular galaxies as they peer deeply into the universe, which is equivalent to looking back
                    in time. These galaxies are abundant in the early universe, before spirals and ellipticals developed.

            <h2>Can Galaxies Collide?</h2>
            <p>
                While the distances between galaxies seem large, so too are galaxies’ diameters. 
                Compared to stars, galaxies are relatively close to one another. They interact and even collide. 
                When galaxies collide, they pass through each other; their stars don’t crash into each other because of the
                immense distances between them. However, gravitational interactions between colliding galaxies could create
                new waves of star formation, supernovas and even black holes. Collisions do distort a galaxy’s shape and computer 
                models show that collisions between spiral galaxies can eventually make ellipticals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four billion years from now, our own Milky Way galaxy is destined for a collision with the neighboring 
                spiral Andromeda galaxy. The Sun will likely be flung into a new region of our galaxy, but our Earth and solar system 
                are in no danger of being destroyed. Andromeda, also known as M31, is now 2.5 million light-years away, 
                but it is inexorably falling toward the Milky Way under the mutual pull of gravity between the two galaxies 
                and the invisible dark matter that surrounds them both.

            <h2>How do Galaxies form?</h2>
            <p>
                Galaxies form out of immense clouds of gas that collapse and rotate.
                As they evolve, stars form within them. Entire galaxies can collide, changing their appearance. 
                Looking deep into space, we see galaxies at earlier stages in their lives, and learn more about their evolution. 
                They are more numerous, display unusual shapes, and have episodes of energetic outbursts.

            <h2>Is the Milky Way a large Galaxy?</h2>
            <p>
                The Milky Way is considered an average-sized galaxy. It stretches for 105,700 light-years in diameter and may contain 
                at least 100 billion planets and around 400 billion stars.<br>
                Now, if the Milky Way is an average galaxy, how does a giant galaxy look like? Well, it would like IC 1101, 
                which is currently the largest galaxy ever discovered.
                IC 1101 is more than 50 times larger than the Milky Way. 
                It stretches for over 5.5 million light-years across. This galaxy may have trillions of stars and planets.

            <h2>Can Humans travel to another Galaxy?</h2>
            <p>
                Humans could travel to other galaxies, but the technology involved would look very different from what we currently have. 
                Galaxies are thousands or even millions of light-years away from one another, the distance is almost unfathomable.<br>
                The required technology for intergalactic travel is far beyond our current capabilities. 
                They are mostly on the subject of speculation, hypothesis, or science fiction.<br>
                Reaching the speed of light is crucial for intergalactic space travel, and this presents its own problems and limits. 
                Even if we were to travel at the speed of light, it would still take us thousands of years, in the best case, 
                to reach another galaxy.
